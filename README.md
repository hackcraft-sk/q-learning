# StarCraft Bot using Q-Learning

## Introduction for developers

1. Use Windows for development and testing (it's possible otherwise but not convenient)
2. You need **SC: BroodWar** and **BWAPI** + **BWMirror** for development. Follow initial [setup instructions on SSCAITournament](http://sscaitournament.com/index.php?action=tutorial).
3. This bot is just a bit more complicated BWMirror bot. *No further installation requirements are needed*.

## Running

1. Open this project in Eclipse
2. Make sure that you include BWMirror and possibly other libraries in build path.
3. Run this project (Bot class)
4. Run ChaosLauncher and select a map, where you want to play

## How to use git

**Be careful what you push to master**. Other developers branch from master, so if you break the code in master, it will be broken for everybody. Be a team player.
